Tool in the Python 3 language to extract from the VASP output files (CONTCAR, OUTCAR, PROCAR).

extraction.py: Extracts information from CONTCAR and OUTCAR files about the crystal lattice, DFT calculation and parameters that allow you to automate the analysis of results.
bandas.py: Provides the band structure.

Texturas.py: Provides the band structure as well as the projections of the orbitals (S, P, D, Px, Py, Pz) and the spin components (Sx, Sy, Sz).
input files: input_Texturas.txt

Contribuicao.py: Gives the contribution of each ion for a given band and dot-k in the form of a txt file.
input files: input_Contribuicao.txt

Localizacao.py: Allows you to define 3 regions(A, B, C) of your crystal lattice and make a projection in the band structure, of the contribution of each region for each band and k-point.
